excerpt: "How training for a marathon changed my approach to learning and goal-setting."

I believe *process* and *rigor* are the qualities that will allow me to reach my goals. A couple years ago, I realized I could literally do anything I wanted to do if I developed a plan and stayed committed to my training.

To test my theory, I chose a goal that seemed out of reach at the time. Without any prior running experience, I decided to train for a marathon. I found a training program online and gave it a shot.

Early on, the most difficult part was putting on my shoes and getting out the door. I could come up with a thousand reasons for why it was ok to skip that day's run. I allowed my mind to wander and ask questions like "Should I run today?", "It's too hot to run", "I'm sore, I don't want to develop an injury", "I'm getting sick", "It's too late". The problem was I hadn't yet *decided* that I was going to run.

Eventually, I learned to *decide* to do things. I simply didn't allow myself to contemplate if I was going for a run. This made my experience much more simple. I was going to go for a run. It wasn't a question of *if*, it was only an observation of how that day's experience would be.

The process of training and finishing the marathon completely changed my mindset and approach to what's possible. I realized the biggest limit on myself was my mind. Conquer my mind and I could conquer my life. Process and rigor allowed me do something that at one point, seemed impossible.
