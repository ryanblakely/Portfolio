A minimal Pomodoro timer that lives in your macOS menu bar.

## The Pomodoro Technique

Work in focused 25-minute intervals, then take a short break. After four intervals, take a longer break. It's a simple system for maintaining focus throughout the day.

## Features

- **Menu Bar Integration** - Always visible, never in the way
- **Simple Controls** - Start, pause, and skip with a click
- **Unobtrusive Notifications** - Gentle alerts when it's time to break

Built with Swift and SwiftUI for a native Mac experience.
