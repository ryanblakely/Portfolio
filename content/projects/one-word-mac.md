The macOS companion to the iOS Speed Reader app, bringing RSVP reading to your desktop.

## How It Works

Rapid Serial Visual Presentation displays one word at a time in a fixed position. Without eye movement between words, you can read significantly faster while maintaining comprehension.

## Features

- **Desktop Optimized** - Takes advantage of the larger screen and keyboard shortcuts
- **File Import** - Drag and drop documents directly into the app
- **Adjustable Speed** - Fine-tune your reading pace with precise controls

Built with Swift and SwiftUI for native macOS integration.
