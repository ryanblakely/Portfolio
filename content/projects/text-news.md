A no-frills news aggregator that strips away the noise and lets you focus on headlines.

## Philosophy

News sites are cluttered with ads, autoplaying videos, and attention-grabbing layouts. Text-News takes the opposite approach: just headlines and links, nothing more.

## Features

- **Text-Only** - No images, no videos, no distractions
- **Content Filter** - Optionally filter out topics you'd rather not see
- **Fast Loading** - Minimal payload means instant page loads

Built with React and TypeScript for a snappy, responsive experience.
