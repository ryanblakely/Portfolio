An iOS app that uses Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) to help you read faster.

## How It Works

Instead of scanning lines of text, RSVP displays one word at a time in a fixed position. Your eyes stay still while words flash by, eliminating the time spent moving between words.

## Features

- **Multiple Formats** - Import ebooks, PDFs, URLs, or paste text directly
- **Adjustable Speed** - Start slow and gradually increase your reading pace
- **Progress Tracking** - Pick up where you left off

Built natively with Swift and SwiftUI for a smooth iOS experience.
